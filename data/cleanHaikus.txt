i am nobody a red sinking autumn sun took my name away keep straight down this block then turn right where you will find a peach tree blooming make up you mind snail you are half inside your house and halfway out you moths must leave now i am turning out the light and going to sleep all right you sparrows the sun has set and you can now stop your chattering sparrow's excrement becomes quickly powdery on sizzling pavements the dog's violent sneeze fails to rouse a single fly on his mangy back on winter mornings the candle shows faint markings of the teeth of rats with a twitching nose a dog reads a telegram on a wet tree trunk the webs of spiders sticking to my sweaty face in the dusty woods a bloody knife blade is being licked by a cat at hog-killing time in the falling snow a laughing boy holds out his palms until they are white one magnolia landed upon another in the dew-wet grass as the sun goes down a green melon splits open and juice trickles out a sparrow's feather on a barb of rusty wire in the sizzling heat sleety rain at night seasoning swelling turnips with a tangy taste heaps of black cherries glittering with drops of rain in the evening sun the day is so long that even noisy sparrows fall strangely silent spring begins shyly with one hairpin of green grass in a flower pot an apple blossom trembling on a sunlit branch from the weight of bees leaving its nest the sparrow sinks a second then opens its wings like a fishhook the sunflower's long shadow hovers in the lake in the setting sun each tree bud is clinging fast to drying raindrops quickly vanishing the first drops of summer rain on an old wood door the crow flew so fast that he left his lonely caw behind in the fields crying and crying melodious strings of geese passing a graveyard one autumn evening a stranger enters a village and passes on through a wounded sparrow sinks in clear cold lake water its eyes still open amidst the flowers a china clock is ticking in the dead man's room with indignation a little girl spanks her doll – the sound of spring rain the scarecrow's old hat was flung by the winter wind into a graveyard coming from the woods a bull has a lilac sprig dangling from a horn the summer moonlight gleams upon a blacksmith's forge and cools red embers all the city's bells clang deafeningly this midnight frightening the new year no birds are flying the tree leaves are still as stone – an autumn evening in an old woodshed the long points of icicles are sharpening the wind little boys tossing stones at a guilty scarecrow in a snowy field standing patiently the horse grants the snowflakes a home on his back tossing all day long the cold sea now sleeps deeply on a bed of stars a silent spring wood a crow opens its sharp beak and creates a sky a cock's shrill crow is driving the spring dawn stars from out of the sky from the skyscraper all the bustling streets converge towards a spring sea while plowing the earth all my crows are visiting a neighboring farm surely that spring moon so yellow and so fragile will crack on a cloud holding too much rain the tulip stoops and spills it then straightens again like a spreading fire blossoms leap from tree to tree in a blazing spring the sudden thunder startles the magnolias to a deeper white leaving the doctor the whole world looks different this autumn morning i almost forgot to hang up an autumn moon over the mountain they smelt like roses but when i put on the light they were violets a freezing morning i left a bit of my skin on the broomstick handle a spring sky so clear that you feel you are seeing into tomorrow a balmy spring wind reminding me of something i cannot recall i feel autumn rain trying to explain something i do not want to know a lakeshore circus an elephant trumpeting waves on blue water the christmas season a whore is painting her lips larger than they are while she undresses a spring moon touches her breasts for seven seconds the baby's hiccough dies down and the hum of flies fills the sunny room a peg-legged man stumps about in the garden pruning the roses the first day of spring the servant wears her blonde hair in a new manner a valley village lies in the grip of moonlight how lonely it is in a light spring rain an old woman is spitting into a handkerchief a dead mouse floating atop a bucket of cream in the dawn spring light in this rented room one more winter stands outside my dirty window pane my cigarette glows without my lips touching it — a steady spring breeze settling on the screen of the crowded movie house a white butterfly an empty sickbed an indented white pillow in weak winter sun while crows are cawing poppies are dutifully deepening their red a nude fat woman stands over a kitchen stove tasting applesauce a washerwoman dyes a tub of water blue – the sunlit spring wind in a barbershop the stench of soap and hair – a hot summer day the green cockleburs caught in the thick wooly hair of the black boy's head i am paying rent for the lice in my cold room and the moonlight too entering my town in a heavy fall of snow i feel a stranger i have lost my way in a strange town at night – a sky of old cold stars on a bayonet and beyond the barbs of wire – a spring moon at dawn shut in the ice box a cricket chirps sleepily in an alien winter at a funeral strands of filmy spider webs on coffin flowers the sport stadium every seat is taken by whirling snowflakes across the table cloth ants are dragging a dead fly in the evening sun creamy plum blossoms once upon a time there was a pretty princess just enough of snow to make you look carefully at familiar streets the arriving train all decorated with snow from another town my shadow was sad when i took it from the sand of the gleaming beach a small spring island is being measured by a ribbon of ship smoke the summer rainstorm drenches chickens in the fields making them smaller so cold it is now that the moon is frozen fast to a pine tree limb the big light in the fog was but a little lantern when we came to it in this tiny pond the great big lake in which i swam as a boy from across the lake past the black winter trees faint sounds of a flute amid the daisies even the idiot boy has a dignity my cold and damp feet feel as distant as the moon on this autumn night a limping sparrow leaves on a white window sill lacy tracks of blood in a damp attic spilling out grains of sawdust a wounded rag doll for six dark dank years a doll with a christmas smile in an old shoe box a sick cat seeks out a stiff and frozen willow under which to die sitting in spring rain two forgotten rag dolls their feet in water the blindman stumbles pauses then walks slower into the autumn night a slow creeping snail moments later i could not see it anywhere as the popcorn man is closing up his wagon snow begins to fall while plucking the goose a feather flew wildly off to look for snowflakes the snowball i threw was caught in a net of flakes and wafted away high above the ship on which immigrants sail are departing geese the caw of a crow on a distant summer field goes a silent train an empty seashore taking a long summer with it a departing train in my sleep at night i keep pounding an anvil heard during the day burning out its time and timing its own burning one lonely candle the naked mountains washing themselves in spring rain as green fields look on that sparrow bent dawn its head tucked beneath its wing – sewing a button a leaf chases wind across an autumn river and shakes a pine tree a flood of spring rain searching into drying grasses finds a lost doll a darting sparrow startles a skinny scarecrow back to watchfulness the scarecrow's big sleeves advertising in the sun huge red tomatoes with solemnity the magpies are dissecting a cat's dead body the creeping shadow of a gigantic oak tree jumps over the wall as my anger ebbs the spring stars grow bright again and the wind returns from the cherry tree to the roof of the red barn a cloud of sparrows flew in the summer sun near an empty whiskey bottle a sleeping serpent in the burning sun a viper's tongue is nudging a cigarette butt droning autumn rain a boy lines up toy soldiers for a big battle standing in the snow a horse shifts his heavy haunch slowly to the right on my trouser leg are still a few strands of fur from my long dead cat empty autumn sky the bright circus tents have gone taking their music from the dark still pines not a breath of autumn wind to ripple the lake i cannot find it that very first violet seen from my window this autumn evening is full of an empty sky and one empty road around the tree trunk a kitten's paw is flicking at an absent mouse a tolling church bell a rat rears in the moonlight and stares at the steeple
